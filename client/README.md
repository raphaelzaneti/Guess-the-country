# Guess the country game!
Guess the country game! I'm developing this project with ReactJS and some Bootstrap. For the next features, I intend to fix some bugs, improve the design. 

This was my second project in web development, and at the beggining I created this game in Vanilla JS and using an JSON file that I got from GitHub. Right now, the game has a lot of new features, including a interactive map with the already guessed countries, and a lot of new hints, including the the "flag hint" 

I hope you enjoy it! :)

### What is this project?
It's a simple game about geography. The goal is to guess the country based on until 12 hints. As more hints that you use, less points you earn. If your answer is wrong, you earn no points.

### What does this project looks like?
Here goes a loom video about the application inteface:

### What was my motivation?
After I started this project, I realized that I really like geopolitics in general (maps, political issues, diplomacy, flags, different cultures, fun facts about countries, economic internal details, and others). My inspiration was some internet quizzes with the same goal: you must guess the answer by one or some hint(s). 

Also, I like games and, as a hobby, as intend to, in future, develop something similar to this web application in React Native. 

### Why did I build this project?
Games is a fun way to learn how to code. After plan this project, I found an JSON archieve on GitHub with some information about all countries in the world (and also some subnational territories) and started to code it.

Right now, after some months, I found some new sources to collect the data used in the game, and also improved the logics and design. 

To a geography entusiast, this game must be a nice hobby.

### What problem does it solve?
It's a solution for your boredom moments!

### What did I learn?
It was my first contact with Bootstrap, so I had the opportunity to improve the design of my application - if you compare to my first application, the taskManager, you'll see how much better is this game!

Also, I learned how to integrate my application with an external database.

### Future plans
In the next versions, I intend to:
1. Split the application between server and client side, in order to have an addequate division between front and back end;
2. Fix the new bugs;
3. Create dificulty levels;
4. Allow the user to disable some hints;
5. Responsive layout.
